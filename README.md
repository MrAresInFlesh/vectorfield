## Content

A `Java` project made using `Java FX SDK`. The progam simulates a field of modifiable and interacting vectors.
User can:

- Manipulate vectors and their characteristics
- Manipulate the field as a whole and add particles
- Interact with a menu acting on the field

## Context

As part of the *P2* course, a project must be carried out in a group during the 2<sup>th</sup> semester.

The objective of this course, and of the project, is to allow students to deepen their knowledge in a language, but more particularly to gain experience through group work, and the follow-up of a project from a common idea until its realization and creation. The realization of this project involves the use of the `Java` programming language.
